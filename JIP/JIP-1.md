### Specification

Invite Daniel Hong (@unifiedh) as a Joon Validator.

### Motivation

Daniel has requested to join the DAO through my personal KakaoTalk message. He has been a bitcoiner since 2008 and building universes at nonce community. As defining himself as 21-year-old peter pan, Daniel has became one of the most dedicated friends to Joon for three years to date.

### Rationale
I hereby request all of the token holders of $JOON agree upon on this proposal to invite Daniel Hong to `Decentralized Joon Jung DAO`.
